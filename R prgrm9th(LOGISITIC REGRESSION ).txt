	2. LOGISTIC REGRESSION

Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on input variables.
It's often used for classification problems where you need to categorize data into two groups

Create the dataset
# Small dataset: Hours studied vs. Pass/Fail
students <- data.frame(
  Hours = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8),
  Pass = c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
)

# View data
students
Fit logistic regression
# Convert Pass to a factor
students$Pass <- as.factor(students$Pass)

# Fit logistic regression model
model <- glm(Pass ~ Hours, data = students, family = binomial)

it shows,
{Warning message: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred}

summary(model)

Predict probabilities
# Predict probability of passing
predicted_probs <- predict(model, type = "response")
data.frame(Hours = students$Hours, 
           Predicted_Prob = round(predicted_probs, 3))

Convert probabilities to classifications
# Classify as Pass if probability > 0.5
predicted_class <- ifelse(predicted_probs > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Confusion matrix
table(Predicted = predicted_class, Actual = students$Pass)
Make a new prediction
new_data <- data.frame(Hours = 5.5)
predict(model, new_data, type = "response")

Interpretation:
* Intercept (-6.6165): When Hours = 0, the log-odds of passing are -6.6165 (very low probability).
* Hours coefficient (1.5050): Each extra hour studied multiplies the odds of passing by
e1.5050?4.50e^{1.5050} \approx 4.50e1.5050?4.50 — a strong effect.
* p-values (~0.055): Just above 0.05, meaning with this tiny dataset, the result is borderline significant.
Confusion matrix
Interpretation:
* True Negatives (3): Hours = 1, 2, 3 ? predicted fail, actually failed.
* False Negatives (1): Hour = 4 ? predicted fail (49% cut-off), but actually passed.
* True Positives (4): Hours = 5, 6, 7, 8 ? predicted pass, actually passed.
* False Positives (0): None.
Accuracy = (3 + 4) / 8 = 87.5%

Prediction
*  For 5.5 hours of study, your model predicts ~84% probability of passing.
*  If your threshold is 0.5, the classification would be "Pass".
